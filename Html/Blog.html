                    Music is one of the most significant discoveries of humans. And I am well aware of why I used the
                    term ‘discovery’ rather than ‘creation.’ It is because the origin of music is not certain. A theory
                    that I personally believe is that music already existed in nature.
                    <br>
                    It is assumed that humans discovered and observed the rhythm that natural resources interacting with
                    each other caused. Soon humans started mimicking those phenomena creating sound and eventually
                    adjusting the harmony through patterns, repetition, and tonality to create music.
                    <br>
                    Music lets the musician and the listener express the innermost feeling without having to speak.
                    Music has the sublime power of influencing people beyond geographical boundaries. Music can
                    effortlessly strike a chord in our hearts and give rise to many such underlying feelings. Music
                    allows people of various social, political, geographical, and cultural backgrounds to come together
                    and feel the same sensations.
                    <br>
                    The influence of music on us is the very reason that distinguishes humans from other animal species.
                    Since music has always been so influential in our lives that a field of study is based on music. In
                    that study field of study, students learn the history of music, the use of different instruments to
                    create sound, and ways to compose new pieces of music.
                    <br>
                    Music is beyond social and religious discrimination, as the delight it gives to everyone is
                    unbiased. Music can, to an extent, help establish peace in our lives, for many, use it as a medium
                    to relax their minds. Many individuals claim that music is the closest thing to God that humans
                    experience while being alive.
                    <br>
                    Medical sciences have theories about the healing qualities of music. But it is nothing surprising
                    because we use music to heal our wounds of the heart. Music is also a vessel of peace that lets us
                    escape from the turmoil of chaos. Negative feelings often subside when our favored music is being
                    played.

                    An easy way to get rid of anxiety is by listening to the form of music with a soothing
                    melody. Music can also raise the notions of nostalgia in us. Sometimes our memories are
                    associated with a certain melody, or we can associate a new melody with an old instance.
                    <br>
                    Some music compositions are so powerful that they can make us miss a place that we haven’t
                    visited yet or a feeling that the listener hasn’t felt. Musicians are nothing less than
                    magicians as their music creations are pure magic—the divine, gifted human with the talent
                    of being skilled in many components for creating music. I pray to God that people may never
                    be denied their right to listen to music or create it.
                    <br>
                    Music helps individuals to connect with their true inner self. In the company of good melodious
                    music, we feel as if our soul takes an inward journey and keeps us as peace. Music has the great
                    power to evoke emotions in the listener and provides instant pleasure. Sometimes it feels as if our
                    surroundings and our actions are all working together to create a beautiful melody the same as the
                    harmony and rhythm of the music.

                <h2 class="slideheading">Definition</h2>
                There is no simple definition of music which covers all cases. It is an art form, and opinions come
                into play. Music is whatever people think is music. A different approach is to list the qualities
                music must have, such as, sound which has rhythm, melody, pitch, timbre, etc.
                <br>
                These and other attempts, do not capture all aspects of music, or leave out examples which
                definitely are music. According to Thomas Clifton, music is "a certain reciprocal relation
                established between a person, his behavior, and a sounding object".[1]p10 Musical experience and the
                music, together, are called phenomena, and the activity of describing phenomena is called
                phenomenology.
                </p>
                <p id="History" class="slidecon">
                <h2 class="slideheading">History</h2>
                Even in the stone age people made music. The first music was probably made trying to imitate sounds
                and rhythms that occurred naturally. Human music may echo these phenomena using patterns, repetition
                and tonality. This kind of music is still here today. Shamans sometimes imitate sounds that are
                heard in nature.[2][3] It may also serve as entertainment (games),[4][5] or have practical uses,
                like attracting animals when hunting.[4]
                <br>
                Some animals also can use music. Songbirds use song to protect their territory, or to attract a
                mate. Monkeys have been seen beating hollow logs. This may, of course, also serve to defend the
                territory.
                <br>
                The first musical instrument used by humans was probably the voice. The human voice can make many
                different kinds of sounds. The larynx (voice box) is like a wind instrument.
                <br>
                The oldest known Neanderthal hyoid bone with the modern human form was found in 1983,[6] indicating
                that the Neanderthals had language, because the hyoid supports the voice box in the human throat.[7]
                <br>
                Most likely the first rhythm instruments or percussion instruments involved the clapping of hands,
                stones hit together, or other things that are useful to keep a beat. There are finds of this type
                that date back to the paleolithic. Some of these are ambiguous, as they can be used either as a tool
                or a musical instrument
                <br>
                <h5>Ancient times</h5>
                It is not known what the earliest music of the cave people was like. Some architecture, even some
                paintings, are thousands of years old, but old music could not survive until people learned to write it
                down. The only way we can guess about early music is by looking at very old paintings that show people
                playing musical instruments, or by finding them in archaeological digs (digging underground to find old
                things). The earliest piece of music that was ever written down and that has not been lost was
                discovered on a tablet written in Hurrian, a language spoken in and around northern Mesopotamia (where
                Iraq is today), from about 1500 BC. The Oxfords Companion to Music, ed. Percy Scholes, London 1970
                <br>
                <h5>Middle Ages</h5>
                Another early piece of written music that has survived was a round called Sumer Is Icumen In. It was
                written down by a monk around the year 1250. Much of the music in the Middle Ages (roughly 450-1420) was
                folk music played by working people who wanted to sing or dance. When people played instruments, they
                were usually playing for dancers. However, most of the music that was written down was for the Catholic
                church. This music was written for monks to sing in church. It is called Chant (or Gregorian chant).
                <br>
                <h5>Renaissance</h5>
                In the Renaissance (roughly 1400–1550) there was a lot of music, and many composers wrote music that has
                survived so that it can be performed, played or sung today. The name for this period (Renaissance) is a
                French word which means "rebirth". This period was called the "rebirth" because many new types of art
                and music were reborn during this time.

                Some very beautiful music was written for use in church services (sacred music) by the Italian composer
                Giovanni da Palestrina (1525–1594). In Palestrina's music, many singers sing together (this is called a
                choir). There was also plenty of music not written for the church, such as happy dance music and
                romantic love songs. Popular instruments during the Renaissance included the viols (a string instrument
                played with a bow), lutes (a plucked stringed instrument that is a little like a guitar), and the
                virginal, a small, quiet keyboard instrument.
                <br>
                <h5>Baroque</h5>
                In the arts, the Baroque was a Western cultural era, which began near the turn of the 17th century in
                Rome. It was exemplified by drama and grandeur in sculpture, painting, literature, dance, and music.[18]
                In music, the term 'Baroque' applies to the final period of dominance of imitative counterpoint, where
                different voices and instruments echo each other but at different pitches, sometimes inverting the echo,
                and even reversing thematic material.

                The popularity and success of the Baroque style was encouraged by the Roman Catholic Church which had
                decided at the time of the Council of Trent that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct
                and emotional involvement. The upper class also saw the dramatic style of Baroque architecture and art
                as a means of impressing visitors and expressing triumphant power and control. Baroque palaces are built
                around an entrance of courts, grand staircases and reception rooms of sequentially increasing opulence.
                In similar profusions of detail, art, music, architecture, and literature inspired each other in the
                Baroque cultural movement as artists explored what they could create from repeated and varied patterns.
                Some traits and aspects of Baroque paintings that differentiate this style from others are the abundant
                amount of details, often bright polychromy, less realistic faces of subjects, and an overall sense of
                awe, which was one of the goals in Baroque art.

                The word baroque probably derives from the ancient Portuguese noun "barroco"[19] which is a pearl that
                is not round but of unpredictable and elaborate shape. Hence, in informal usage, the word baroque can
                simply mean that something is "elaborate", with many details, without reference to the Baroque styles of
                the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
                <br>
                <h5>Classical period</h5>
                In western music, the classical period means music from about 1750 to 1825. It was the time of composers
                like Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven. Orchestras became bigger, and
                composers often wrote longer pieces of music called symphonies that had several sections (called
                movements). Some movements of a symphony were loud and fast; other movements were quiet and sad. The
                form of a piece of music was very important at this time. Music had to have a nice 'shape'. They often
                used a structure which was called sonata form.

                Another important type of music was the string quartet, which is a piece of music written for two
                violins, a viola, and a violoncello. Like symphonies, string quartet music had several sections. Haydn,
                Mozart and Beethoven each wrote many famous string quartets.

                The piano was invented during this time. Composers liked the piano, because it could be used to play
                dynamics (getting louder or getting softer). Other popular instruments included the violin, the
                violoncello, the flute, the clarinet, and the oboe.
                <br>
                <h5>Romantic period</h5>
                The 19th century is called the Romantic period. Composers were particularly interested in conveying
                their emotions through music. An important instrument from the Romantic period was the piano. Some
                composers, such as Frederic Chopin wrote subdued, expressive, quietly emotional piano pieces. Often
                music described a feeling or told a story using sounds. Other composers, such as Franz Schubert wrote
                songs for a singer and a piano player called Lied (the German word for "song"). These Lieder (plural of
                Lied) told stories by using the lyrics (words) of the song and by the imaginative piano accompaniments.
                Other composers, like Richard Strauss, and Franz Liszt created narratives and told stories using only
                music, which is called a tone poem. Composers, such as Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms used the piano to
                play loud, dramatic, strongly emotional music.

                Many composers began writing music for bigger orchestras, with as many as 100 instruments. It was the
                period of "Nationalism" (the feeling of being proud of one's country) when many composers made music
                using folksong or melodies from their country. Lots of famous composers lived at this time such as Franz
                Schubert, Felix Mendelssohn, Frederic Chopin, Johannes Brahms, Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Richard Wagner.

                <h5>Modern times</h5>
                From about 1900 onwards is called the "modern period". Many 20th century composers wanted to compose
                music that sounded different from the Classical and Romantic music. Modern composers searched for new
                ideas, such as using new instruments, different forms, different sounds, or different harmonies.

                The composer Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951) wrote pieces which were atonal (meaning that they did not
                sound as if they were in any clear musical key). Later, Schoenberg invented a new system for writing
                music called twelve-tone system. Music written with the twelve-tone system sounds strange to some, but
                is mathematical in nature, often making sense only after careful study. Pure twelve-tone music was
                popular among academics in the fifties and sixties, but some composers such as Benjamin Britten use it
                today, when it is necessary to get a certain feel.

                One of the most important 20th-century composers, Igor Stravinsky (1882–1971), wrote music with very
                complicated (difficult) chords (groups of notes that are played together) and rhythms. Some composers
                thought music was getting too complicated and so they wrote Minimalist pieces which use very simple
                ideas. In the 1950s and 1960s, composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen experimented with electronic
                music, using electronic circuits, amplifiers and loudspeakers. In the 1970s, composers began using
                electronic synthesizers and musical instruments from rock and roll music, such as the electric guitar.
                They used these new instruments to make new sounds.

                Composers writing in the 1990s and the 2000s, such as John Adams (born 1947) and James MacMillan (born
                1959) often use a mixture of all these ideas, but they like to write tonal music with easy tunes as
                well.

                <h2 class="slideheading">Key signatures</h2>
                A musical key defines the group of pitches that will be used in a musical composition.

                It sets the pattern that makes up the principal major or minor scale and harmonic “home” of the song.

                The key of a piece of music is determined by a set of sharps or flats (accidentals) called a key
                signature.

                A key signature appears at the beginning of a line of music to indicate which notes must be altered from
                their original state to fit the key.

                Keys are the harmonic and melodic context for the action in a song, they provide a template that helps
                musicians know what notes to play when playing with each other.

                A song may start and one key and end in another, or visit a different key before returning. This is
                known as a key change.

                You can identify the name and root note of key by following the pattern of sharps and flats outlined in
                the circle of fifths.

                We’ve put together step by step guides for identifying the key of a piece of sheet music, find your own
                song’s key or even finding the key of an individual sample.

                <h2 class="slideheading">Rhythm is the pulse of a song</h2>
                Rhythm is a basic aspect of music and a deep subject in its own right.

                We covered the basics extensively in our overview, but it’s worth paying more attention to rhythm since
                it’s such a major element of modern music.

                Groove and feel can get you a long way, but a solid understanding of rhythm can take you to new places.

                Beats are just rhythms represented in the piano roll in your DAW. If you don’t know how to arrange a
                rhythm in your DAW, here’s a guide to making your first beat.

                You can even bring back some of the human feel in a rhythm using DAW swing.

                Standard straight rhythms are the basis for most beats and grooves, but polyrhythms are how you take
                your rhythmic sense to next level.

                Polyrhythms are hybrid grooves that combine different rhythmic patterns together.

                It seems complicated at first, but our in-depth explanation makes it easy to bring polyrhythms into your
                songwriting.
